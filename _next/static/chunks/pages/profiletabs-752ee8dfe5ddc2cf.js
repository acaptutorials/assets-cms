The sharp decline of GHG emissions from 1992-1994 was associated with the fall of Soviet Union2. From 1994, the GHG emissions increased by 15% in 2019. The energy sector accounts for the highest share of emissions at 68%. The emissions from the remaining sector, agriculture contributes to 18.3%. Enteric fermentation, use of synthetic fertilizers, and manure left on pasture accounts for 1.60MT CO2-eq, equivalent to 88% of the total emissions from the agricultural sector. The NDC's commits to reduce emissions by 40% from the 1990’s emission levels. For the energy sector, the mitigation measure includes doubling the share of renewable energy sources and extension Nuclear Power Plant. In agriculture, the mitigation includes minimizing enteric fermentation (63% share of GHG emission to agriculture), and sustainable soil and nutrient management. Further, improving public transportation, support in uptake of electric cars, as well as increasing 12.9% forest cover by 2030 are among the interventions specified in the updated NDC."},{title:"Climate Risks",key:"risks",content:"The country has moderate levels (rated 5.4 with risk increasing over the past three years) of disaster risk based on a rating from the Index for Risk Management1 for flood (4.3 out of 10) and drought (4.9 out of 10). Although flood ranked as a moderate risk it poses a high risk to subsistence agriculture. Improvement in hydromet services, particularly flood early warning will be an important step in building climate resilience2. Extreme precipitation can also trigger landslides and mudflows. It is estimated that ~4.1% of the total land area of Armenia is at risk to landslide, and almost a third of the population is exposed3. Drought affects agriculture, particularly when non-climate resilient crops are, and land management practices are used affecting 25,000 poor households in 20014. Heatwave is also a climate threat that negatively affects sectors, particularly in the emergence of water supply, labor productivity, and heath. Non-climate-related risk includes earthquakes which caused 25,000 deaths in 1988."},{title:"Long term climate trends",key:"trends",content:"There has been an observed warming trend of about 1.23\xb0C between 1929–2016, and this trend will continue in the future. An estimated 17% increase in temperature is likely in 2050 and as much as 43% in 2090 considering the middle-of-the-road emission scenario. Key climate risks, such as drought and heatwave, can be exacerbated by rising temperatures, potentially incurring social, natural, and economic damage if no adaptation measures are implemented. Climate change may increase the incidence of heatwaves by as much as 18% under high emission scenarios compared to the current 3% level due to rise in temperatures. Historical records suggests that there is an observed decline in average monthly precipitation, particularly in western regions and in arid northern regions. In the future, long-term changes (either increase or decrease) in precipitation trends shows no conclusive evidence. However, increases in extreme events may be likely if precipitation shifts away from the summer months and reduced glacial mass may. Slight increase in extreme rainfall (5-day rainfall) events maybe likely in northern and eastern parts of Armenia."},{title:"Impacts of climate change and variability, vulnerability, and readiness",key:"impacts",content:"The impacts of climate change cut across various sectors (e.g., natural resources, economics, and communities, Table 2). Expansion of arid and semi-arid lands are likely in the future with increased frequency and intensity of drought leading to soil and land degradation. Potential impacts are changes to ecosystems leading to forest loss, increased frequency of forest fire, pest and disease outbreak, and introduction of invasive species. Water quality and level may also be affected due to the projected decrease of river flow by 39% by the end of century (2090). The performance of hydropower is likely to be affected by reduced water supply in the future, caused by increased drought incidence, evapotranspiration, and reduced glacial mass. Water scarcity and increased water demand will also affect agricultural yields in key agricultural production regions, such as the Ararat Valley. Particularly vulnerable are communities with prevalent poverty and malnutrition rates, which are less likely to cope with the impacts of climate change, particularly heat stress and food insecurity due to agricultural losses and water shortages. The vulnerability rating (ND-GAIN1 rank of 69 out of 192 countries) did not change over the past 25 years, the readiness has positively changed for Armenia. With risk index increasing over the past years calls for climate action to ensure preparedness and plan for suitable adaptation options, preventing maladaptation."},{title:"Adaptation and Mitigation Priorities",key:"adapt",items:2,content:"The government prioritizes optimizing the energy structure, protection, and restoration of the environment and ecological systems. Emphasis on interventions focuses on the GHG reduction for the energy sector includes development of renewable energy and energy efficiency as indicated in the Republic of Armenia 2-14-2025 Strategic Program of Perspective Development. The Strategic Program for the Development of the Energy Sector until 2040 primary highlights energy security with emphasis on nuclear energy, modern gas fired generation plants, and shift to solar and wind energy. In particular, the country is developing a 1000MW solar energy capacity until 2030 to increase energy mix of renewable energy. For the agricultural sector (aligned with Strategy 2020-2030 of Armenia), there is an emphasis on reducing enteric fermentation, improved nutrient management, and organic farming, and animal breeding. Other sectors-specific climate mitigation actions included in the first updated NDC are the following: \n\n    - Transport: Increased efficiency of public transport\n    - use of renewable energy\n    - stimulation and support in uptake of electric vehicles.\n    - Improved solid waste management system aligned with the Solid Waste Management System Development Strategy for 2017-2036\n    - Increase in forest cover by 12.9% by 2030 as part of the National Forestry Programme (2021). This would entail increased by 33,000 hectares from the current 262,000 forested area.\n    \n\nArmenia considers natural ecosystem adaptation approach as basis in developing the national adaptation plan (NAP). The NAP process emphasizes the reduction and management of climate risks to minimize losses and building mechanisms enabling adaptation of natural, human, production, and infrastructure. Priority adaptation will be based on vulnerability analysis of:\n\n    - Natural ecosystems (aquatic and terrestrial, including forest ecosystems, biodiversity, and land cover)\n    - Human health\n    - Water resource management\n    - Agriculture, including fishery and forests\n    - Energy\n    - Human settlements and infrastructures\n    - Tourism"},{title:"Finance",key:"finance",content:"Financial support from donors and international development organizations will be required to deliver the commitment to accelerating emission reduction by 2030 and 2050.

disaster risk reduction and management (i.e., strengthening climate information services – disaster early warning and improved climate projections), low carbon energy and transport and infrastructure development including energy efficiency, upstream work to promote climate resilient human settlements and infrastructures (including DRR in infrastructure design), natural resource/environment
